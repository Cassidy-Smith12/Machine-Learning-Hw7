 Exercise 1:
 You have recently been hired by a major enterprise to filter out spam emails. Your manager has 
 given you access to the following three Normal (i.e., not Spam) training emails:
 train_N_I, train_N_II, train_N_III and the following three Spam training emails: train_S_I, train_S_II,
 train_S_III. Classify the following two emails: testEmail_I.txt, testEmail_II.txt as to whether they
 are Normal or Spam (use Na√Øve Bayes classifier). In addition, plot the frequency of words for
 Normal and Spam emails.
